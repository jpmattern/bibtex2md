abstract = {Coastal sediments adjacent to urban centers often receive high loads of organic matter (OM) due to large nutrient inputs from land that stimulate algae blooms. Early diagenetic models describing the remineralization of this OM in sediments have been developed for 50 years. Although these models can be applied to a range of marine sediments, specifying their model parameter values is difficult. In this study, one of the early diagnetic models was applied to simulate sediments in Osaka Bay, Japan and the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) technique was used in order to choose optimal model parameters in the model. Following a sensitivity analysis, we estimated values for six parameters including the ratio of fast-decaying OM to total OM, the ratio of non-degradable OM to total OM, and the carbonâ€“nitrogen ratio. Optimal parameter values were determined by minimizing the misfits between simulated and observed release rates of ammonium and phosphate from the sediments, and vertical profiles of inorganic nitrogen, and phosphorus in the porewater. Simulations with the optimized parameters successfully reduce a dimensionless root mean square error by 68{\%} and agree better with the observed profiles and release rates than without parameter estimation.},

@article{Mattern2018,
abstract = {A procedure to objectively adjust the error covariance matrices of a variational data assimilation system is presented. It is based on popular diagnostics that utilize differences between observations and prior and posterior model solutions at the observation locations. In the application to a data assimilation system that combines a three-dimensional, physical-biogeochemical ocean model with large datasets of physical and chlorophyll a observations, the tuning procedure leads to a decrease in the posterior model-observation misfit and small improvements in short-term forecasting skill. It also increases the consistency of the data assimilation system with respect to diagnostics, based on linear estimation theory, and reduces signs of overfitting. The tuning procedure is easy to implement and only relies on information that is either prescribed to the data assimilation system or can be obtained from a series of short data assimilation experiments. The implementation includes a lognormal representation for biogeochemical variables and associated modifications to the diagnostics. Furthermore, the effect of the length of the observation window (number and distribution of observations) used to compute the diagnostics and the effect of neglecting model dynamics in the tuning procedure are examined.},
